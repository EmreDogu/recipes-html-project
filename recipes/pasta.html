        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This is an extremely simple pasta recipe that I love to make when I don't really feel like cooking!</p> 
            <p>I use rigatoni, but you can use whatever pasta you prefer. This is especially delicious with tomatoes fresh from your garden. Serve with garlic bread and a simple lettuce salad with Italian dressing.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients for 4 servings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (8 ounce) package dry pasta</li>
                <li>1 clove garlic</li>
                <li>1 medium tomato</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat.</li>
                <li>Coarsely chop the tomato and transfer to a small bowl. Sprinkle the tomato chunks with basil, olive oil, and salt. Set aside.<li>
                <li>Once the water is boiling, stir in the rigatoni, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander, and then return the pasta to the pot.</li>
                <li>Pour the tomato mixture over the pasta and toss to mix.</li>
            </ol>
